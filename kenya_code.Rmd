```{r hypotheses}
#Linear regression
##Does the population affect the farming production?
##Is there a positive correlation between Tea and Coffee production?
##The Average household size is higher in counties with higher farming activities.

#ANOVA
##There is a significant difference in "Male," "Female," and "Intersex" populations across counties.

#Mediation
##There is an interaction effect between "Population" density and "Farming" activities, where the impact of farming on household size is more pronounced in densely populated counties.
